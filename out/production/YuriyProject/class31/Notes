Collections Framework
1) ArrayList
2) LinkedList
3) HashSet
4) LinkedHashSet
5) TreeSet
=====================
ArrayList:
is a data structure that stores elements based on index
    1) can hold duplicate values
    2) maintains the insertion order
    3) Dynamic in nature (can adjust the size at runtime)
    4) Underlying data structure is array
When to Use:
    1) when we are not sure about the size
    2) Fast retrieval based on index

LinkedList:
    1) can hold duplicate values
    2) maintains the insertion order
    3) Dynamic in nature (can adjust the size at runtime)
    4) Underlying data structure is doubly linked list
When to use"
    1) when we are not sure about the size
    2) When we have to modify the data most of the time we should be using LinkedList

HashSet:
    1) No Duplicates
    2) Allows null
    3) No Order
When to use:
    1) When we have to remove the duplicates from the data (we don't care about the order)

LinkedHashSet:
    1) No Duplicates
    2) Allows null
    3) Order is maintained
When to use:
    1) When we have to remove the duplicates from the data and we don't want to lose the order

TreeSet:
    1) No Duplicates
    2) No null values
    3) Data is sorted in natural order
When to use:
    1) When we have to remove the duplicates from the data (we don't care about the order)
