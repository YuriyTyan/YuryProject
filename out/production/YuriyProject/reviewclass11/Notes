Collections Framework

collection of classes and interfaces that can store and manipulate the data using different
built-in data structures like arrays, linked Lists and sets.

Wrapper class:
1) are object Equivalent of primitive types
2) Collections can not work with primitive data types they can only work with objects
3) Wrapper class provide built-in methods to convert data the types and some useful Constants

ArrayList:
it implements List interface
1) It can hold duplicate values with no issues
2) Insertion order is maintained
3) Dynamic in nature, can adjust the size at run time automatically
4) Underlying data structure is Arrays
Methods in ArrayList Class:
add() -- adds the element in natural sequence
add() -- we can specify the index for insertion
get (int index) -- returns the element at specified index
remove() -- removes the elements at specified index
remove(Object) -- object will be removed

LinkedList:
1) It can hold duplicate values with no issues
2) Insertion order is maintained
3) Dynamic in nature, can adjust the size at run time automatically
4) Underlying data structure is doubly LinkedList

Sets:
Is an interface we know three classes which implement Set interface
1) HashSet, LinkedHashSet, ThreeSet
HashSet
    ===Properties
    1) no Duplicates
    2) no order
    3) use when Fast Search is required
    4) Allows null value
2) LinkedHashSet
    1) no duplicates
    2 insertion order is maintained
    3) Nulls are allowed
3) TreeSet
    1) No duplicates
    2) all elements are sorted in natural order
